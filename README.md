# Imageboard
An instagram-like, single-page application for uploading photographs. I built this at Spiced Academy during week 9 of the 12-week course on Javascript-focused web development. Check out the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

## Technologies
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: Angular, Handlebars
- **Backend**: Node, Express
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, AWS S3

## Description
We made the imageboard in order to learn about the popular Angular library, and practice generating templates with Handlebars.

## Preview
When loaded, the imageboard displays the most recent photos uploaded in a horizontal scroll format.

Users have the option to explore either an 'about' page (no screenshot), or upload their own photograph.

Viewers or other users also have the opportunity to comment on each other's photos.
